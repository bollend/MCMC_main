# MCMC_main
MCMC fitting routine to fit model spectra to observations of jets in evolved binary systems


The main script is main.py, which takes the object id and the input parameter file as command line arguments, i.e.:  

`python main.py -o BD+46_442 -dat BD+46_442_x_wind.dat`

You can create new 'jet' objects in Cone.py
